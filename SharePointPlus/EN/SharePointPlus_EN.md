## Azure AD setup

### Azure AD

SharePointsPlus uses Azure AD for identity and access management. This means that users accessing SharePointsPlus are stored and managed in Azure AD.

### App registration

In order to use authentication with SharePointPlus, you need an App Registration, which must be created in the Azure Portal.
In Azure Portal, enter App Registrations in the search bar at the top and click on the "App Registrations" service as shown in the screenshot.

![Fig.3 Azure Portal - App Registrations](../files/SPPAbb3_DE.png)
Fig.3 Azure Portal - App Registration

Next, press "New Registration" and fill in any display name for the application there. Account type is set to "single client".
We set the redirect URI to "web" and add this URL:
<https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm> .
After that, the app can be registered.

![Fig.4 App registration](../files/SPPAbb4_DE.png)
Fig.4 App registration

### Api permissions

In order to be able to access the API, necessary permissions are required.
For this, we enter "App Registrations" again in the search bar and select our newly created app. Then we click on "API permissions" in the navigation bar (left margin).
on "API Permissions."

Click on "Add Permissions" and select "Microsoft Graph."
There, they select "Delegated Permissions" and look for "Files.ReadWrite.All." Check the box and next enter "Sites.ReadWrite.All." Put a check mark there as well. Now you need to select "Add Permissions" and check that they have been applied. By default, "User.Read" is already added. If this is not the case, add this permission.

![Fig.5 API Permissions Overview](../files/SPPAbb5_DE.png) Fig.5 API Permissions Overview

In order for the permissions to be granted, an admin must approve them. Once this is done, the status is green and the permissions have been granted.

![Fig.6 Permissions final status](../files/SPPAbb6_DE.png) Fig.6 Permissions final status

### Certificates and secrets

The last step is the generation of a secret, which will be needed later.

To do this, click on Certificates & Secrets in the navigation bar and select "New secret client key". Give it a description/name and set a time period when this secret key should expire. Then click on "Add".

<span style="color:blue">Important:</span> Copy the newly created secret key and store it securely (e.g. in a password manager). The key will no longer be visible later!

## The Basics

The basic idea of the SharePointPlus App is the automated upload of the documents generated in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. These documents are enriched with the additional information (metadata) specified in Business Central. The following additional information is currently transferred to Microsoft SharePoint.

Fig.32 SharePointPlus in use ](../files/SPPAbb32_EN.png) Fig.32 SharePointPlus in use

<span style="color:blue">Note:</span> You need the Microsoft SharePoint licenses in addition to this app. These are not included in this app.

## Configure SharePointPlus

Call up the SharePointPlus Setup page again cf. (Fig. 25: Activate and/or configure SharePointPlus). After this has been activated you will now see the configuration page of the application.
The user who calls the configuration page needs the following permissions:

- SPP Admin KTC - permission set for the administrator.
- SPP LIC User KTC - license permission for SharePointPlus

The configuration page is grouped thematically.

## General information

![Fig.33 General information - connection to your SharePoint ](../files/SPPAbb33_DE.png)

Fig.33 General information - connection to your SharePoint

In the figure you can see a section of the setup page. As soon as you have inserted your information, it will be stored in the system.
Now click on Create Access Token. This will generate an Access Token that will allow you to access Microsoft SharePoint.
<span style="color:blue">Note:</span> In Microsoft SharePoint you need appropriate rights to the libraries, lists and documents.

## Setting up the dimensions and format rules

In the following dimension screen, you can set two dimension codes that will be used to sort your files. Dimensions also allow you to have the system generate reports on the linked content. Select here from your previously entered list. Missing dimensions and their codes must be defined via the dimension management before they can be used by SharePointPlus.

![Fig.34 Assignment of dimensions to be passed to SharePoint ](../files/SPPAbb34_DE.png)

Fig.34 Assignment of the dimensions to be passed to SharePoint

Here it should be mentioned that SharePointPlus works with four central dimensions: DIM1 and DIM2, which you can specify here, and the document ID (doc.id), which make the files distinguishable from each other.
DIM1 and DIM2 can be freely selected from all dimensions stored in Business Central.

Doc.ref is a dimension defined by Business Central. You do not need to consider it when setting up SharePointPlus.

The fourth dimension is ref.ID, which is the identification of the reference between documents. What distinguishes the ref.ID from the others is the fact that, unlike the first three, the ref.ID is not assigned globally.

The global metadata is given and evaluated by the system, and therefore can only perform global evaluations. The ref.ID, on the other hand, works at the row level, which allows for more accurate statistics.

Another dimension is the doc.id. This is always the series of numbers that distinguishes one document from the others. You do not need to define it further.

Occasionally you will also see the DocType dimension. This is created automatically and indicates the document type. In this way, orders can be distinguished from sales in the evaluation.

![Fig.35 Defining the file format for the SharePoint document](../files/SPPAbb35_DE.png) Fig.35 Defining the file format for the SharePoint document

Next, you define the standardized format that SharePointPlus should work with. First you define your desired date format, then the separator you want to use to separate the partial information from each other. For example, a file name can take the following form:
<span style="color:blue">Beispiel:</span> YYY-DD-MM - (dash) â†’ 2022-21-10 - UserManual.pdf

### Set up available pages and lists

This is where you set up pages and lists to be managed using SharePointPlus.

![Fig.36 : Connect to available SharePoint libraries](../files/SPPAbb36_DE.png) Fig.36 : Connect to available SharePoint libraries

<span style="color:blue">Note:</span>Please note that you need to expand the infobox area for this. The SharePointPlus interface is displayed only inside the infobox area.
The files associated with the selected customer are displayed here on the side. The files are sorted according to your settings defined in the installation. So you have everything at a glance.

## The filter function

In the upper left corner of the SharePointPlus interface, you will find a small funnel icon if you had filters set up for the retrieved lists when you set up SharePointPlus. This icon is for your information only. If it is not displayed, no filter was set up for the list.
The filter function is automatically applied in the background if you have set up a filter and activated the function. You do not need to select anything else in SharePointPlus.
The filters set up match the field name in Business Central with the column names in SharePoint.

## The SharePointPlus menu

You can expand or collapse certain lists and folders here according to your needs, so that you can navigate the documents as easily as possible. Clicking on SharePoint Plus opens a drop-down menu that allows you to perform various actions in SharePointPlus.

![Fig.46: : The SharePointPlus Menu ](../files/SPPAbb46_DE.png) Fig.46 : The SharePointPlus Menu

With Create access authorization you can, as in the setup of the application, create a new access for the current user and update it if necessary. This may require the user to log in again.
Using SharePoint Settings, you can access the setup page from 5.2 to make short-term changes to the settings. For example, you can add more libraries to your lists here, as well as adjust minor display settings.
Reload document refreshes the SharePointPlus view. This can be useful if you have made changes in the settings.
Upload file allows you to add more files to the view. It may take some time for the document to be processed and stored correctly by SharePointPlus. This is not a cause for concern.
Open in Excel downloads a file of the document to your PC, which you can use to open the overview in Excel. This file is automatically a read-only copy; however, in the Excel interface you can enable editing.
Here you will now also find the new Upload to SharePoint function. When you press this button, the respective documents (i.e. either all or only the filtered ones) are uploaded to SharePoint at the same time. So you don't have to link them there manually, but you can do several actions in one step.
If you have filters set up but you don't want to use them now, you can disable them via Turn Filters On/Off. The lists will still be filtered in the background, but all files in the list will be displayed for you.
Documents managed with SharePointPlus can of course also be uploaded to SharePoint in the usual way and retrieved there. SharePointPlus only takes care of the sorting and direct linking of your SharePoint documents in your listing.
With Print in the task list above your view you can print or send the selected table somewhere. Furthermore, you can filter your selection here so that for example only the sales quotations are printed.

![Fig.47: : Upload document to SharePoint by selection in print dialog ](../files/SPPAbb47_DE.png) Fig.47 : Upload document to SharePoint by selection in print dialog.
